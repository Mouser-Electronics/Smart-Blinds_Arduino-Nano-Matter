**DEBUGGING TIPS **

**Matter Library Debugging Strategy **

When working with Arduino Matter libraries, compiling the sketches can be time-consuming. To streamline the process, we recommend initially commenting out or excluding the Matter libraries until you're confident the core functionality of your code is working as expected. In our approach, we first tested individual components—starting with Arduino build-in LED, followed by the stepper motor, the illuminance sensor, the temperature sensor, and finally the distance sensor. Once we confirmed that each device was functioning correctly, we integrated the Matter libraries and proceeded with debugging. This staged approach helps isolate issues and saves time during the compilation process. 

 

**Connecting to Alexa - Key Troubleshooting Steps **

If you encounter difficulties connecting the Arduino Nano Matter board to the Alexa app, follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve the issues: 

1. Decommission the Matter Device: If your device was previously commissioned, ensure you upload code to decommission it. This is crucial for resetting the connection. 

2. Burn the Bootloader: After decommissioning, use the Simplicity Bootloader from SiLabs to burn the bootloader onto the board.  

3. Reset the Echo Hub: Before reconnecting the Arduino board to the Alexa app, reset your Echo hub. This ensures a fresh connection. 

4. Reconnect to Alexa: If the device still fails to connect, repeat the steps above, as missing one can prevent successful pairing. 

5. Network Credentials Issue: If you receive a prompt asking for network credentials in the Alexa app, this likely means the device was not fully decommissioned. Follow the decommissioning steps again. 

 
Note: The Matter-generated code for your device remains the same regardless of resetting or re-uploading. Once the QR code is generated, you can save and reuse it, as it will be associated with your specific Arduino Nano board. 
 


**Design Tip for I²C Sensors **

If the sensors you’re using lack documentation for checking their I²C addresses, use an I²C scanner sketch to identify the address. If the scanner returns multiple addresses, it's often due to improperly soldered pins or floating connections. Additionally, verify if your sensors require external pull-up resistors. For example, in our project, the SDA channel of the temperature sensor required a 4.3kΩ pull-up resistor between VDD and SDA, which significantly improved reading consistency. 

 

**Stepper Motor Control with TMC2209 **

For the TMC2209 driver we used, the motor current is regulated by adjusting the screw on the top right corner of the board. Ensure that all pins are properly connected, as we encountered an issue where the 5V input for the internal logic of the TMC2209 was not connected, preventing the stepper motor from functioning correctly. To identify the correct motor wiring, use a multimeter to check continuity between motor wires. If the multimeter beeps, those two wires should be connected to the A1 and A2 (or B1 and B2) pins on the TMC2209. Incorrect wiring may result in the motor vibrating without rotation or not functioning at all. 

 

**Sensor Address Verification **

Always verify that you are using the correct addresses for both the illuminance, distance and the temperature sensors. This will prevent issues during communication and ensure proper functionality of your sensors.
